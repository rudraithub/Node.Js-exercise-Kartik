    Callback is an asynchronous equivalent for a function. It is called at the completion of each
 task. In Node.js, callbacks are generally used. All APIs of Node are written in a way to 
 supports callbacks. For example: when a function start reading file, it returns the control 
 to execution environment immediately so that the next instruction can be executed.

    In Node.js, once file I/O is complete, it will call the callback function. So there is no 
blocking or wait for File I/O. This makes Node.js highly scalable, as it can process high 
number of request without waiting for any function to return result.
